##Qucikie
QUICKIE is for the students by the students with reward-based incentive. 
This is an IN-campus student-run initiative that provides convenient and efficient delivery services for students within the college. 
The aim of the project is to help students save time and effort by allowing them to order commodities like food and other essential items from the comfort of their dorms or classrooms.
